Affected by the issue is the ReplicaSet with the name nginx-f8-mf8zhf7427 in the namespace ba-test. Here is the corresponding yaml file:

```yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations: {}
  labels:
    app: nginx-f8
  name: nginx-f8
  namespace: ba-test
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-f8
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-f8
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        resources: 
          requests:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 200Mi
```.

Here is the error simplification and solution recommendation to guide your remediation:

Error: pods nginx-f8-mf8zhf7427-8ngsf is forbidden: exceeded quota: ba-test, requested: cpu=500m, used: cpu=0, limited: cpu=400m
Solution: The Pod does not get created. The output shows that creating the Pod would cause the cpu request total to exceed the cpu request quota.
