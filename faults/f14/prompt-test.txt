Affected by the issue is the ReplicaSet with the name nginx-f14-7nf4c8dfwk in the namespace ba-test. Here is the corresponding yaml file:

```yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations: {}
  labels:
    app: nginx-f14
  name: nginx-f14
  namespace: ba-test
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-f14
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-f14
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 80Mi 
```.

Here is the error simplification and solution recommendation to guide your remediation:

Error: pods nginx-f14-7nf4c8dfwk-hp97k is forbidden: minimum memory usage per Container is 100Mi, but request is 80Mi
Solution: The output shows that the Pod does not get created, because it defines a container that requests less memory than the enforced minimum.
