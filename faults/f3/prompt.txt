Here is the error simplification and solution recommendation to guide your remediation:

Error: 0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) had untolerated taint {key1: value1}. preemption: 0/1 nodes are available: 1 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling.
Solution: The taint has key key1, value value1, and taint effect NoSchedule. This means that no pod will be able to schedule onto node1 unless it has a matching toleration.
