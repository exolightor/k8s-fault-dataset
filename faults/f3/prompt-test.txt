Affected by the issue is the Pod with the name nginx-f3-84ltkm82bb-pk9kn in the namespace ba-test. Here is the corresponding yaml file:

```yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx-f3
  name: nginx-f3
  namespace: ba-test
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-f3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-f3
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx-f3
        resources: 
          limits: 
            cpu: 200m
            memory: 100Mi
      restartPolicy: Always
```.

Here is the error simplification and solution recommendation to guide your remediation:

Error: 0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) had untolerated taint {key1: value1}. preemption: 0/1 nodes are available: 1 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling.
Solution: The taint has key key1, value value1, and taint effect NoSchedule. This means that no pod will be able to schedule onto node1 unless it has a matching toleration.
