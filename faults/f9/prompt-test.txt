Affected by the issue is the ReplicaSet with the name nginx-f9-bw244cxb6f in the namespace ba-test. Here is the corresponding yaml file:

```yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations: {}
  labels:
    app: nginx-f9
  name: nginx-f9
  namespace: ba-test
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-f9
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-f9
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        resources: 
          requests:
            cpu: 200m
            memory: 500Mi
```.

Here is the error simplification and solution recommendation to guide your remediation:

Error: pods nginx-f9-bw244cxb6f-64pc9 is forbidden: exceeded quota: ba-test, requested: memory=500Mi, used: memory=0, limited: memory=400Mi
Solution: The Pod does not get created. The output shows that creating the Pod would cause the memory request total to exceed the memory request quota.
