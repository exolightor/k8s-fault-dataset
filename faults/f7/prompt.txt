Here is the error simplification and solution recommendation to guide your remediation:

Error: 0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) didn't match pod affinity rules. preemption: 0/1 nodes are available: 1 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling.
Solution: Depending on your pod priority and preemption settings, the scheduler might not be able to find an appropriate node for a pod without violating affinity requirements. If so, a pod might not be scheduled.
To prevent this situation, carefully configure pod affinity with equal-priority pods.
