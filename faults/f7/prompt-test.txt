Affected by the issue is the Pod with the name nginx-f7-rt9tltbfpk-5snn7 in the namespace ba-test. Here is the corresponding yaml file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx-f7
  name: nginx-f7
  namespace: ba-test
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:

      app: nginx-f7
  template:

    spec:

          limits: 
            cpu: 1
            memory: 128Mi
      restartPolicy: Always
      affinity:

          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:

              matchExpressions:
              - key: app
                operator: In
                values:
                - nginx
            topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
```.

Here is the error simplification and solution recommendation to guide your remediation:

Error: 0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) didn't match pod affinity rules. preemption: 0/1 nodes are available: 1 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling.
Solution: Depending on your pod priority and preemption settings, the scheduler might not be able to find an appropriate node for a pod without violating affinity requirements. If so, a pod might not be scheduled.
To prevent this situation, carefully configure pod affinity with equal-priority pods.
