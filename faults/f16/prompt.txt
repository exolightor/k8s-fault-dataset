Here is the error simplification and solution recommendation to guide your remediation:

Error: The service has a too high response time. CPU usage is 201m/200m, the number of replicas is 1 and the number of users is 2.
Solution: Increase the CPU limit for the service.

Explanation: Given that the current CPU usage is 201m out of a total limit of 200m, it seems that the service is consistently using more CPU than allocated. To resolve this issue, increasing the CPU limit will allow the service to utilize more resources when needed, reducing the response time. However, it's essential to monitor the service closely after making changes to ensure that the increased resource allocation does not lead to other issues such as excessive memory usage or instability.
