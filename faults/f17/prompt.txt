Here is the error simplification and solution recommendation to guide your remediation:

Error: The service has a too high response time. CPU usage is 30m/200m, the number of replicas is 1 and the number of users is 20.
Solution: Increase the number of replicas to handle the increased load.

Action Steps:
1. Identify the service causing the issue by checking the response time metrics in your monitoring tool.
2. Check the CPU usage of the service, which is currently at 30m/200m (15%).
3. Determine the number of replicas for the service, which is currently set to 1.
4. Given that the number of users is 20 and the service is experiencing high response time, it's likely that the current number of replicas is insufficient to handle the load.
5. Scale up the number of replicas for the service to a number that can effectively handle the load while keeping CPU usage within acceptable limits. This could be 2 or more replicas depending on the specific performance characteristics of your application and infrastructure.
6. Monitor the system to ensure that the response time improves and CPU usage remains within acceptable limits after scaling up the number of replicas.
