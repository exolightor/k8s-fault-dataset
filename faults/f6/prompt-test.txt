Affected by the issue is the Pod with the name nginx-f6-fqqrlstqkr-s6889 in the namespace ba-test. Here is the corresponding yaml file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx-f6
  name: nginx-f6
  namespace: ba-test
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-f6
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-f6
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx-f6
        resources: 
          limits: 
            cpu: 1
            memory: 128Mi
      restartPolicy: Always
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: os
                operator: In
                values:
                - linux
```.

Here is the error simplification and solution recommendation to guide your remediation:

Error: 0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) didn't match Pod's node affinity/selector. preemption: 0/1 nodes are available: 1 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling.
Solution: A node selector specifies a map of key/value pairs that are defined using custom labels on nodes and selectors specified in pods.
For the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the pod must have the same key/value node selector as the label on the node.
