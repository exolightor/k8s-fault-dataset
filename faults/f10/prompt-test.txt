Affected by the issue is the ReplicaSet with the name nginx-f10-zfsfj9xvb4 in the namespace ba-test. Here is the corresponding yaml file:

```yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations: {}
  labels:
    app: nginx-f10
  name: nginx-f10
  namespace: ba-test
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-f10
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-f10
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        resources: {}
```.

Here is the error simplification and solution recommendation to guide your remediation:

Error: pods nginx-f10-zfsfj9xvb4-56ffr is forbidden: failed quota: ba-test: must specify cpu for: nginx; memory for: nginx
Solution: If quotas are enabled in a namespace for compute resources like cpu and memory, users must specify requests or limits for those values; otherwise, the quota system may reject pod creation. Hint: Use the LimitRanger admission controller to force defaults for pods that make no compute resource requirements.
