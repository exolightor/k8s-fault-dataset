Affected by the issue is the ReplicaSet with the name nginx-f12-g2m99n99cf in the namespace ba-test. Here is the corresponding yaml file:

```yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations: {}
  labels:
    app: nginx-f12
  name: nginx-f12
  namespace: ba-test
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-f12
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-f12
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 1m
            memory: 128Mi      
```.

Here is the error simplification and solution recommendation to guide your remediation:

Error: pods nginx-f12-g2m99n99cf-s8c98 is forbidden: minimum cpu usage per Container is 100m, but request is 1m
Solution: The output shows that the Pod does not get created, because it defines an unacceptable container. That container is not acceptable because it specifies a CPU request that is lower than the enforced minimum.
