Affected by the issue is the Pod with the name paymentservice-tkfpcmwc7m-frdsb in the namespace ms-demo. Here is the corresponding yaml file:

```yaml

      securityContext:

      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 5
```.

Here is the error simplification and solution recommendation to guide your remediation:

Error: the last termination reason is OOMKilled container=server pod=paymentservice-tkfpcmwc7m-frdsb
Solution: The OOMKilled reason shows that the container tried to use more memory than its limit.
Your next step might be to check the application code for a memory leak. If you find that the application is behaving how you expect, consider setting a higher memory limit (and possibly request) for that container.
