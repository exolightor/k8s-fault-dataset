Affected by the issue is the Pod with the name nginx-f2-bhnctlfgck-sb7gg in the namespace ba-test. Here is the corresponding yaml file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations: {}
  labels:
    app: nginx-f2
  name: nginx-f2
  namespace: ba-test
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-f2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-f2
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: webserver
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: nginx
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 200m
            memory: 50Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 200m
            memory: 50Mi
```.

Here is the error simplification and solution recommendation to guide your remediation:

Error: the last termination reason is OOMKilled container=nginx pod=nginx-f2-bhnctlfgck-sb7gg
Solution: The OOMKilled reason shows that the container tried to use more memory than its limit.
Your next step might be to check the application code for a memory leak. If you find that the application is behaving how you expect, consider setting a higher memory limit (and possibly request) for that container.
